### Monitoring
- Collect sensor data and visualize it on a dashboard.
- Set up alerts for critical events (e.g., low soil moisture, extreme temperatures).
- Monitor the health and performance of the IoT devices.

### Data Management
- Use a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) to store sensor data.
- Implement data processing and analysis to gain insights.

### Cloud Platform
- Host the web application and database.
- Use cloud services for data storage, processing, and analysis.
- Manage and monitor the IoT devices.

### Software Components
- **Microcontroller Firmware**: Code to read sensor data and control actuators.
- **Web Application**: A user interface to visualize sensor data, control the system, and configure settings.
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: Scripts or applications to process and analyze the sensor data.
