# Smart-AgroTech
To develop a Smart AgroTech system that monitors various environmental factors and automates tasks like irrigation and fertilization to optimize crop yields and resource usage.

# IoT Project

## Overview
A complete IoT and AI-based solution for modern farming, integrating real-time environmental monitoring, automated irrigation, and disease detection to improve productivity and sustainability.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌧️ Automatic irrigation based on real-time soil moisture
- 🌡️ Monitors environmental factors: temperature, humidity, light, wind
- 🧪 Analyzes soil health: NPK, pH, moisture
- 💧 Water quality and level monitoring
- 💨 Air quality monitoring for sensitive crops
- 🤖 Live camera feed for security
- 🚷 Motion Based Protection and Alert System
- 📲 GSM-based alerts via SMS / HTTP
- 🌐 Cloud dashboard for live monitoring & control
- 🔌 Automated control of pumps, lights via relays
- 🔋 Solar + battery-powered operation for field deployment

### Monitoring
- Collect sensor data and visualize it on a dashboard.
- Set up alerts for critical events (e.g., low soil moisture, extreme temperatures).
- Monitor the health and performance of the IoT devices.

### Data Management
- Use a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) to store sensor data.
- Implement data processing and analysis to gain insights.

### Cloud Platform
- Host the web application and database.
- Use cloud services for data storage, processing, and analysis.
- Manage and monitor the IoT devices.

### Software Components
- **Microcontroller Firmware**: Code to read sensor data and control actuators.
- **Web Application**: A user interface to visualize sensor data, control the system, and configure settings.
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: Scripts or applications to process and analyze the sensor data.
