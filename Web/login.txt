Login Page:

The page features a stunning background image related to modern farming.

The login form has a "glassmorphism" effect, making it semi-transparent and modern.

You can enter a username and password and select either "User" or "Admin".

For this demo, the valid credentials are:

Username: admin, Password: admin123

Username: user, Password: user123

If you enter incorrect details, an error message will appear.

Weather Dashboard:

Upon a successful login, you are taken to the weather dashboard.

It displays the current weather for a sample location ("Tenkamijar, IN") with temperature, conditions, and other details like humidity and wind speed.

A 5-day forecast is shown with icons and temperature ranges.

All weather data is currently static (hard-coded in the JavaScript) but is set up in a way that it could easily be connected to a live weather API.

The "Logout" button will take you back to the login screen.
